 Level 1: Title & Hook

Name:  RES  
 It is supposed to be a short version of the word Reservation, as the game takes place on a fictional native american reservation. I like how short it is because it sounds mysterious and you wouldn’t be able to tell what the game is about from just the name. 

🕹️ Level 2: Choose Your Genre

🎮 Core Genre: Survival Horror 

📜 Scrolling / Perspective: 1st Person

 🧗 Movement & Abilities: Running, Jumping, Vaulting , Night Vision, Thermal Optics

 ⚔️ Action / Conflict: Survival, Shooting, Hazards

 🏗 Structure / Progression: Linear 

🎨 Aesthetic / Tone: Serious / atmospheric,  Dark / horror 

🧩 Challenge Style: Exploration, Puzzle-solving,  Resource management

RES would fit the Survival Horror genre because it focuses on resource management (getting ammo or med kits etc / limited amount of space) and being vulnerable. (the player faces an enemy that they can't defeat or is much stronger than them) It would be a 3D game in the 1st person, meaning that you play the game through a character's eyes. This would add to the atmosphere and the scare factor of the game. 

🕹️ Level 3: Backstory

The main location of the game is the Gran trueno reservation; a fictional native american reservation. It has a few small towns and rich wildlife including deer, elk, bears, wolves, etc. It is also home to a colony of skinwalkers, which the protagonist learns shortly after his arrival. 

The protagonist Grant Yager sneaks into the Gran trueno reservation to hunt illegally for one of his affiliates. Eventually he finds a deer and gets ready to shoot it. However, before he pulls the trigger, the tribal police catch him. While taking him to a detention center, they hit a deer with their car. It starts to change shape… 

🕹️ Level 4: Characters

Protagonist:

The main protagonist of this game is a 29 year old male named Grant Yager. He is  6'1" and has dirty blonde hair with a slimmer build. (You would never see any of this because it is in 1st person.) He is unemployed but hunts illegally for money. He is a cheat, but he is also plucky. 

Antagonist:

The antagonist/ enemies of this game would be fictional skinwalkers. Skinwalkers are a monster sometimes portrayed in native american folklore and are most often known for shape shifting into animals. One of the core mechanics of the game would be to identify skinwalkers from normal animals and then either run away or fight them. 

Secondary Characters: 

Tribal Police: These are 2 police officers for the Gran trueno police department. They take him to a detention facility, but they crash before they can get there.

🕹️ Level 5: Target Market / Audience

The target market for RES would likely be teens and adults. Since it has horror elements, it would not be suited for children. The difficulty would also be hard but not unfair, so players would benefit from previous experience with video games. 

🕹️ Level 6: Player Motivations

The player would progress through different areas on the map, while searching for items to help them survive. Hopefully the core mechanics of the game would be enough to give the player an enjoyable experience and to keep them playing. 

🕹️ Level 7: Unique Selling Point (USP)

The main selling point of the game is the unique enemy type of the skinwalkers, I haven’t seen them portrayed in a video game yet. It would provide a unique and unnerving experience, knowing that any animals you encounter could end up being your demise…

🕹️ Level 8: Inspirations & Competition

Resident Evil 4:  RES would take a lot of inspiration from this game. For example, searching for resources in an area, hands on puzzles, shooting based combat, etc. If I was making RE 4 I would probably make it a little scarier, and add more weapons but this game came out 20 years ago so it's very impressive for its time. 

Rain World: One of Rain World’s unique selling points is its advanced enemy AI. It feels like the creatures in that game are real, and have their own brains and objectives compared to most games where enemies have set actions they can take. RES would take this mechanic to make the fights with the skinwalkers feel more organic, and scarier. Rain World is very unforgiving and movement is sluggish (is supposed to add to the world and is more of a feature ), If I made the game I would fix these issues but it is personal preference. 

Competition: Resident Evil 8 / other action adventure horror games

Some people might think that this is just like other action adventure horror games but the main selling point would be the advanced enemy AI of the skinwalkers, and being stalked by them. It would try to be refreshing so that it doesn’t become monotonous, as you progress skinwalkers would inhabit different animals with different tactics. 

🕹️ Level 9: Goals

Players should feel a sense of thrill and hopefully be a little bit scared when playing RES. 

I think the mechanic of being chased by skinwalkers and trying to survive in the wilderness while progressing through new areas will be exciting.
